# Customer Churn Prediction Model

This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts customer churn. It uses several machine learning classifiers like XGBoost, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors, along with techniques for hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search and Randomized Search.

## Features

- Predicts customer churn using machine learning models.
- Provides explanations for churn predictions using OpenAI API.
- Includes hyperparameter tuning for optimizing model performance.
- Interactive web app built using Streamlit.
- Visualizations for customer metrics and model performance.

## Installation

To install the project and its dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ChurnPredictionModel.git
   cd ChurnPredictionModel
   Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate # For Linux/Mac
Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Running the Streamlit App
You can run the interactive web app locally using Streamlit:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run main.py
This will launch a local server, and you can open the app in your browser.

Running Predictions Programmatically
You can also run the churn prediction models directly via the command line:

bash
Copy code
python predict_churn.py --customer_id 12345
Replace 12345 with the customer ID you want to predict churn for.

Model Details
The project uses the following machine learning classifiers:

XGBoost Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
K-Nearest Neighbors
The models are optimized using hyperparameter tuning (Grid Search and Randomized Search) to enhance performance.
